        vehicle. But there is an evil serpent; a Viper that tempts you to take a bite out of the asphalt. With a tasty
        500-hp V10 powering a mere 3,300-lb roadster, the Dodge Viper SRT-10 tricks you into playing music with the loud
        pedal</p>

            src="06.floatingContentBoxes2.png" alt="Viper Rear" width="155" height="115"> But for otherwise nice couple
        who need only two seats this is the car that will shame those who come up against them.</p>
